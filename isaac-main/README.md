# Cafesquad Team Repo   :+1:

## Elevator pitch:

For the decision-makers of a chain of cafe restaurant    
Who want to aggregate all their branchesâ€™ sales in one place       
The Analytics Dashboard      
Is an ETL pipeline solution with the ability to identify wide trends in data     
That will allow us to collect and visualize all transaction data, generated by all individual coffee shops, and place them in 1 single location        
Unlike the current isolated manual analyses, our product will allow for a quick comprehensive insight access

## Team members:

## How to run files:

Ensure you have Docker Desktop installed and running.

On local host run, $ docker compose up -d command which creates and runs MySQL and Admin containers.  

Place in your working directory the src's files next to the csv_data folder with the csv files to extract into py variables.

Execute transform.py that imports extract_csv.py module and has cleanse/transform functionalities  and produces lists of dictionaries with self-explanatory variable names representing the database schema tables' data. Next, using a load.py module imported to transform.py create the 'dockerized' database tables and populate them with data from the py vars.
